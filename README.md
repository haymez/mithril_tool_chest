# Mithril Widgets

A collection of tools to be used with Mithril.js

This project is currently in development! Feel free to check it out but realize that much of it is subject to change.

### Current Components:

* Table
  * Takes in a 2-dimensional array
  * first sub-array is header row
  * Column sorting on header click
  * pagination and infinite scrolling are both supported

### Future Work:

* Drag and Drop
  * Allow users to drag and drop elements 
  * callback will be called when item is dropped in a specified area

* Client Side validation tools
  * Collection of methods wrapped around m() to assist in client side validation. 

This project is definitely in beta mode right now but will hopefully continue to come together quickly. Eventually I will be making a site to host examples of all the widgets
